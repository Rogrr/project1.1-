# project1.1-
Javascript App using bootstrap 


This is the first phase of your web site project. We will start with a Bootstrap starter page. I recommend using this one.

https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_templates.php Links to an external site.

There are more on the get bootstrap site. 

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/ Links to an external site.

You will just need one page at this phase and we will add pages as you build the site. 

Modify the page to include some simple information about you and this course. 5pts

You will add the activity 6 Income tax application to your Bootstrap page. (if you didn't submit this activity or yours had errors, you can send me an email and schedule a meeting to go over it together) In order to keep the styles that came with the original files you will need to copy the css file into the folder for this project and link the css after the bootstrap css link. Remember the cascade. You will link the js file use for this at the bottom of your bootstrap page. This will go at the bottom of your html page just like it did for the activity. 

Create a new folder or repository for this project. Upload all of the supporting files. Make sure it it pushed to pages and you have tested it. 5pts

Submit the link to the newly created Bootstrap page. it is easiest to just name it index.html but as long as the link works you can use any filename.

#project 1.2 

 Create the application by following the instructions below. After you get it working you will then modify it to fit into your project site.
 
• Create an 2nd page for your project. Create a link on your menu for the new page. Make sure the new page uses the same layout as your home page but will have different content. This will contain 3 areas that will have headings to click on to expand and collapse. You will pick the topics and create the content. Each section should have a minimum of 5 sentences.

• Create a link on your menu for the new page. Make sure the new page uses the same layout as your home page with a consistent navigation to navigate to your 2 project pages.

• You will need to link the js and css files to the newly created page. You may need to change the css file to fit with your design. Remember to link the css file after the bootstrap css link.
